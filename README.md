# WebstaurantCodeTest
Code test for Webstaurant Store completed in March 2024. This code was tested on Google Chrome in Windows 10 using IntelliJ IDEA to compile and run the test

Test case:
1. Go toÂ https://www.webstaurantstore.com/
2. Search for &#39;stainless work table&#39;.
3. Check the search result ensuring every product has the word &#39;Table&#39; in its title.
4. Add the last of found items to Cart.
5. Empty Cart.

Currently this test case is marked as failing due to a [Metro Drive-Thru Prep Station](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/station-drive-thru-deliv/461CR2430DSS.html) being returned on page 8 of the search results which fails the third requirement of the test case
